# Config

- These are my config files for Ubuntu with Xmonad
- Symlink to every `./files/blah...` from `~/blah...`
- Run `./setup.py` (from this directory) to automate this process

### Scripts

- `./scripts/addFile.py blah...` will copy `~/blah...` to `./files/blah...`

### TODO

- install the necessary packages
